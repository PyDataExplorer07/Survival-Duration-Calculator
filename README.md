Survival Duration Calculator

Overview
The Survival Duration Calculator is a Python tool that calculates the duration a person has lived in various time units, such as months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. By entering your age, the program will return the equivalent time lived in your selected unit.

Features
Convert your age into months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds.
Handles leap years in the day calculation.
Accepts case-insensitive inputs for time units (e.g., "months", "Months", "M").
How It Works
This calculator uses your input age and multiplies it by the number of units in a year, factoring in leap years for day calculations. The results are printed without rounding, providing an accurate representation of the time lived.

Future Improvements
Add an option to calculate based on a specific birthdate instead of just age.
Include more detailed error handling and input validation.
